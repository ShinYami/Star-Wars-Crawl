        <p>BECODE</p>
        <h1>A LONG TIME AGO</h1>
        <p>The march of the virtuous is strewn with obstacles, which are the selfish enterprises that the work of the Evil One never ends. Blessed is the man of good will who, in the name of charity, makes himself the shepherd of the weak whom he guides into the valley of shadow, death and tears, for he is the guardian of his brother and the providence of lost children. Then I will bring down the arm of terrible anger, of furious and fearful vengeance on the ungodly hordes that chase and destroy the sheep of God. And you will know why my name is eternal when the vengeance of the Almighty falls upon you.</p>
